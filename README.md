# Movies-Correlation-Using-Python-Portfolio-Project

# Overview
This project analyzes the correlation between various features of movies using Python. We utilize pandas for data manipulation, matplotlib and seaborn for data visualization, and generate a correlation matrix to understand the relationships between different numerical features in our dataset.

# Introduction
Understanding the relationship between different features of movies, such as budget, gross earnings, and ratings, can provide valuable insights for movie production and marketing strategies. This project aims to visualize these relationships through a correlation matrix.

# Data
The project uses a dataset containing various features of movies, such as budget, gross earnings, and ratings. Make sure your dataset is in a CSV format and includes the necessary numerical columns for correlation analysis.

# Features
1. Calculate the correlation matrix for numerical features.
2. Visualize the correlation matrix using a heatmap.
3. Analyze relationships between movie features like budget, gross earnings, and ratings.

# Here We used
1. Pandas
2. Numpy
3. Seaborn
4. Matplotlib

# Results
The correlation matrix and heatmap will provide insights into how different features of movies are related. This can help in understanding trends and making data-driven decisions in the movie industry.
